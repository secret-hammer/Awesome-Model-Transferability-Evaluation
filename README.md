# Enhancing Model Adaptability: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Transferability in Deep Learning Models

This is the GitHub repository for the paper ***Enhancing Model Adaptability: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Transferability in Deep Learning Models***, which provides corresponding contributions and core codes, as well as the evaluation script for the EMAB framework. This repository will be updated in real-time with the latest progress.

## Evaluation Measures Category System

The transferability evaluation measures are divided into 6 categories based on their inherent computational strategies, as shown in the diagram. For specific explanations of each category, please refer to the original paper.
